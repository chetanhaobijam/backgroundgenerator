# backgroundgenerator
My Solution to Background Generator Exercise on Zero To Mastery Web Developer Course.

The page will display a default <strong>Red-Yellow</strong> gradient when it first loads up. But you can change the gradient by changing the two gradient colors by clicking on the two color inputs.
You can also generate random gradient by clicking on the "Generate Random Gradient" button.
Enjoy!
